### Analysis
+ In this project, I have analyzed a large dataset of the game in `python` to predict the winner in different circumstances.
+ I carried out `data preprocessing`, `Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)`, `Principal Component Analysis(PCA)` and finally winner prediction after thorough `model selection`.
___

### Questions Answered
